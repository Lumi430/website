	<h1>Fun Projects:</h1>

	<h2>Trebuchet</h2>
	<p>Coming soon!
	<h2>Fractals and Chaos</h2>

	<p>I found myself reading a book on chaos theory and became
		fascinated with the Mandelbrot set. I wrote some code in Matlab to
		compute the set and then used GIMP to produce a color image.

		Another interesting fractal: The basin of attraction for the
		canonnical driven damped pendulum. Click <a

	<h2>Coupled Pendulums</h2>

	<p>A few years ago I came across a neat dynamics problem: Find the
		equations of motion for two pendulums connected by a spring. I thought
		that the resulting behavior was interesting, so I made my own
		demonstration model. The frame and pendulums are made of oak, with
		small tension springs. There are six brass rods at the end of each
		pendulum to increase the moment of inertia.

	<h2>Music Compositions</h2>
	<p>After four years of music theory classes, I finally got around
		to composing some music of my own. These were both written (and
		performed) in 2009 while I was at Tufts university.
