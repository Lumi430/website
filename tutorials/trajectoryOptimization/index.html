	<h1>Trajectory Optimization</h1>
	<div class="summary">This page uses the simple example of aiming
		a cannon to illustrate the difference between a few common methods for
		solving a trajectory optimization problem: Single Shooting, Multiple
		Shooting, and Collocation.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="summary">
		All of the following examples have been implemented in Matlab, and are
		available on <a
			href="https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/dscTutorials/tree/master/TrajectoryOptimization/Example_1_Cannon">GitHub</a>.
		I wrote a report on <a
			href="../../research/MattKelly__Transcription_Methods_for_Trajectory_Optimization.pdf">Transcription
			Methods for Trajectory Optimization</a> a while back, which describes
		some the these techniques in more detail. An <a

	 <div class="summary"> There are a wide variety of methods available for solving trajectory optimization problems. 
	 Sometimes the names given to these methods are not consistent, or are even conflicting. To help understand all of the 
	 options, I've created a page for <a href="terminology.html">trajectory optimization terminology</a>.</div>

	<h2>Cannon Example - Problem Description</h2>
	<div class="figure">

	</div>
	<div class="summary">Suppose that you have a cannon, and you
		would like to hit a known target. To make things interesting, let's
		assume that there is air friction and that you would like to minimize
		the amount of powder used for the shot.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="summary">This situation can be modeled as a
		boundary-value-problem, since you know where the trajectory (path of
		the cannon ball) should start and end. The goal is to find the
		trajectory, including the initial velocity of the cannon ball. We will
		assume that: (1) the cannon ball is a point mass, (2) air friction is
		modeled using quadratic drag, and (3) amount of powder is proportional
		to initial speed squared. Thus we can write equations:</div>

	</div>
	<h2>Solution: Single Shooting</h2>
	<div class="figure">
		<img src="sectionBreakTilde.svg" />
	</div>
	<div class="summary">Single shooting works by approximating the
		trajectory using a single simulation. In other words, fire the cannon,
		check where the ball landed, adjust the initial speed, repeat. In math
		terms, the error between the target and where the cannon ball landed
		is called a defect. The optimization algorithm will try to find the
		initial speed such that this defect driven to zero. It turns out that
		single shooting is an effective method for simple problems (like this
		one), but it will fail on problems that are more difficult.</div>

	</div>
	<h2>Solution: Multiple Shooting</h2>
	<div class="figure">
		<img src="sectionBreakTilde.svg" />
	</div>
	<div class="summary">Multiple shooting is very similar to single
		shooting, but it turns out to be much more robust on difficult
		problems. It works by breaking the original problem into many small
		problems, and then solving them in parallel. At the end, each segment
		is constrained to connect to the previous one.</div>

	</div>
	<h2>Solution: Direct Collocation</h2>
	<div class="figure">
		<img src="sectionBreakTilde.svg" />
	</div>
	<div class="summary">Direct collocation is a bit more difficult
		to visualize, since there is no simulation step. Instead, the
		trajectory is approximated using a piecewise polynomial. Physics are
		satisfied by requiring that the dynamics (derivative of the state)
		match the derivative of the polynomial at each collocation point - the
		points that implicitly define the polynomial. In effect, shooting
		methods satisfy dynamics using explicit integration, while collocation
		methods use implicit integration.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="summary">
		There are a wide variety of collocation schemes. Orthogonal
		collocation schemes, developed for computing satellite trajectories,
		use a small number of high-order polynomials. They are extremely
		accurate for problems well behaved solutions. The other extreme is
		direct collocation, which uses a large number of low-order polynomials
		to represent the solution. It tends to be slightly less accurate, but
		can be more robust. Some sophisticated methods (<a
			href="http://www.gpops2.com/">GPOPS</a>) use an adaptive meshing
		routine to iterative change the number of segments and order of the
		polynomials.
