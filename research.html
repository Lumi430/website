        <p>My primary research interest is non-linear control theory, as it applies to dynamical systems. Most of my efforts are spent developing locomotion controllers for energy efficient and robust bipedal walking.</p>

        <h1>A Exam (thesis proposal)</h1>
        <p>I took my A exam in August 2014. My proposal was on the topic of 'Heirarchical Biped Control'. The idea is to do step planning on a reduced model of the robot, which is then used to help generate the motor commands on the full model. In addition to my presentation, I submitted three written reports.</p>

        <h1>Q Exam (qualifying exam)</h1>

        <p>For my qualifying exam (January 2012) I presented a simulation of a tractor trailer truck driving backwards along a curving road. It had partial sensing of its state using noisy sensors, and control of the steering angle and travel speed (both of which were bounded). State estimation was done using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Control was done by using a discrete linear quadratic regulator (dLQR), on the linearized system (about the current state estimate).

        <h1>Undergraduate Thesis - Bone Saw</h1>
        <p>My undergraduate thesis project at Tufts University was designing, fabricating, and testing a new type of surgical bone saw. At the conclusion of the project I submitted provisional patent for my saw design and published the experimental results in the ASME Journal of Medical Devices. I was also worked on two conference papers - one for my saw, and one for a saw designed by another student.</p>

        <h1>Journal of Chem. Education Paper</h1>
        <p>As an undergraduate at Tufts University, I took a chemistry course, which was designed to teach chemistry by attempting to answer the question: "Is hydrogen the fuel of the future?". My final report for the class was included in supplement of the paper that my professor wrote about the course.</p>
