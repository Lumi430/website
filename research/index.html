		<p>My research focus is on methods for controlling complicated
			dynamical systems, particularly walking robots. Along the way, I've
			enjoyed learning to write code for simulation, optimization, and
			control. This page has some of my formal results, including some past
			work.</p>

		<h2>Non-linear robust control for inverted-pendulum 2D walking</h2>
		<p>
			Conference paper for ICRA 2015. The key contribution is a way of posing and solving the
			following constrained optimization problem: "Find a controller that
			can regulate walking speed while preventing all falls, given any
			(bounded) disturbance."

		<h2>A Exam (thesis proposal)</h2>
		<p>I took my A exam in August 2014. My proposal was on the topic
			of 'Heirarchical Biped Control'. The idea is to do step planning on a
			reduced model of the robot, which is then used to help generate the
			motor commands on the full model. In addition to my presentation, I
			submitted three written reports.</p>

		<h2>Q Exam (qualifying exam)</h2>

		<p>For my qualifying exam (January 2012) I presented a simulation
			of a tractor trailer truck driving backwards along a curving road. It
			had partial sensing of its state using noisy sensors, and control of
			the steering angle and travel speed (both of which were bounded).
			State estimation was done using an extended Kalman filter (EKF).
			Control was done by using a discrete linear quadratic regulator
			(dLQR), on the linearized system (about the current state estimate).

		<h2>Undergraduate Thesis - Bone Saw</h2>
		<p>My undergraduate thesis project at Tufts University was
			designing, fabricating, and testing a new type of surgical bone saw.
			At the conclusion of the project I submitted provisional patent for
			my saw design and published the experimental results in the ASME
			Journal of Medical Devices. I was also worked on two conference
			papers - one for my saw, and one for a saw designed by another
			student.</p>

		<h2>Journal of Chem. Education Paper</h2>
		<p>As an undergraduate at Tufts University, I took a chemistry
			course, which was designed to teach chemistry by attempting to answer
			the question: "Is hydrogen the fuel of the future?". My final report
			for the class was included in supplement of the paper that my
			professor wrote about the course.</p>
